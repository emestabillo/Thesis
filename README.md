# THESIS

Front End project for Thesis

### See it live here: https://em-estabillo-thesis.netlify.com/


### Tools I used: 

SCSS, BEM, Flexbox, Grid, Colorzilla (for color matching), npm (for Sass), Netlify

### My notes:

* I wasn’t able to get a dedicated 2-4hrs as required to create the project, but instead took about 12 hours before I submitted.

* The toggle icon was curious: 
It was included in the original design for (what I assumed was) the desktop. It’s usually seen in smaller devices. Since there were no specific instructions for it, I decided to disable pointer events for bigger screens.

* I couldn’t use Font Awesome for this project, which presented a new challenge. I had to incorporate unicodes in place of the menu and eye icons. The eye icon is not exactly a match.

* Admittedly, there are still a few more bugs to fix, especially in the footer. However, this is the best take-home project I've ever worked on so far, since it is more in line with what I am trying to get into as a developer.

Either way, thank you for the opportunity!
