# THESIS

Front End project for Thesis

### See it live here: https://em-estabillo-thesis.netlify.com/


### Tools I used: 

SCSS, BEM, Flexbox, Grid, Colorzilla (for color matching)

### My notes:

* I wasn’t able to get a dedicated 2-4hrs as required to create the project, but instead took about 11 hours to complete it.

* The toggle icon was curious: 
It was included in the original design for (what I assumed was) the desktop. It’s usually seen in smaller devices. Since there were no specific instructions for it, I decided to disable pointer events for bigger screens.

* I couldn’t use Font Awesome for this project, which presented a new challenge. I learned how to incorporate unicodes in place of the menu and eye icons.
